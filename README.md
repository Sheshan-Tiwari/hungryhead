# Hungryhead (Now Demo only)
Hungryhead is a collaborative network for students to share, validate and develop startup ideas with peers and mentors, supported by gamification.

The platform was built on Rails - standard monolith. Currently, this code is used in production for demo purposes only.

The source code is more than a year old and contains many things that could be improved or done better. The repo is now open source and serves as a reference for many things like - building an activity feed with Redis and Postgres, Gamification system using redis, and using redis as secondary data store along with postgres.
