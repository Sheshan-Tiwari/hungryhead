# Hungryhead (Now Demo only)
Hungryhead is a collaborative network for students to share, validate and develop startup ideas with peers and mentors, supported by gamification.

The platform was built on Rails - standard monolith. Currently, the platform is in production only for demo purposes.

The source code is more than 2 years old and contains many things that could be improved or done better.

The repo only serves as a reference to source code.
