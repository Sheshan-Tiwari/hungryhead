<h3 class="semi-bold">The culmination of our quest to start a company</h3>
<div class="m-t-20">
  <p class="fs-16 m-b-10">
  Most of the entrepreneurs when they start out don't pay much attention to the user's real pain point and end up building unwanted products. As starters, most of them neither have practical startup experience nor access to resources.

  <p class="fs-16 bold">The fundamental problems we discovered were - </p>
    <ul class="fs-16">
        <li class="m-b-10">Fear of sharing idea</li>
        <li class="m-b-10"> Lack of initial collaboration with right people</li>
        <li class="m-b-10">Lack of practical startup experience</li>
        <li>Problem and Idea Validation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16 m-b-10">
    We found that the solutions currently available in the market are - either <em>impractical</em> or <em> limited</em>. We set out to solve this problem from the <strong>"Ground Up"</strong> on global scale and that's when we found hungryhead.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16 m-b-10">
    We believe in solving this problem we must have a completely different approach towards entrepreneurship, an approach where there is openness and collaboration, not bounded by location or qualifications. An approach where everyone works together to dissect the idea, solve real problems and achieve shared goals.
  </p>

  <h5 class="bold m-b-10">
    We have built something that we believe could change the way entrepreneurship has been pursued worldwide.
