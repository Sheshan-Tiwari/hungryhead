  <p class="fs-16">
  Most of the entrepreneurs when they start out don't pay much attention to the user's real pain point and end up building unwanted products.

  <p class="fs-16 bold">The fundamental problem we discovered were - </p>
    <ul class="fs-16">
        <li class="m-b-10"> Lack of initial collaboration with right people</li>
        <li class="m-b-10">Lack of practical startup experience</li>
        <li class="m-b-10"> Problem validation and,</li>
        <li>Idea Validation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16">
    We found that the solutions currently available in the market are - either <em>impractical</em> or <em> limited</em>. We set out to solve this problem from the <strong>"Ground Up"</strong> and that's when we found hungryhead.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16">
    We believe in solving this problem we must have a completely different approach towards entrepreneurship, an approach where there is collaboration, not bounded by location or qualifications. An approach where everyone works together to dissect the idea, solve real problems and achieve shared goals.
  </p>

  <h5 class="bold">
    We have built something that we believe could change the way entrepreneurship has been pursued worldwide.
