    Most of the entrepreneurs when they start out don't pay much attention to the problem they are solving. That's why most of them end up building unnecessary products - wasting resources, energy and time.
    <p class="fs-16 text-master bold">The fundamental problem we discovered was -</p>
    <ul class="fs-16 text-master">
        <li class="m-b-10"> Lack of initial collaboration with right people</li>
        <li class="m-b-10"> Not understanding the users real pain point and,</li>
        <li>Idea Validation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16 text-master m-t-20">
    We found the solutions currently available in the market are - either <em>impractical</em> or <em> limited</em>. We set out to solve this problem from <strong>"Ground Up"</strong> and that's when we found Hungryhead. We believe to solve this problem we must have a completely different approach towards entrepreneurship, approach where there is collaboration, not bounded by time or location or qualifications. Approach where everyone works together to dissect the idea, solve real problems and achieve shared goals.
  </p>

  <p class="fs-16 text-master m-t-20">
    Hungryhead is a practical platform that brings together serious entrepreneurial students from schools, colleges and universities worldwide to share, collaborate and validate startup ideas by creating a culture of cross-pollination.

  <h5 class="bold m-t-20">
    We have built something that we believe could change the way entrepreneurship has been pursued worldwide.
