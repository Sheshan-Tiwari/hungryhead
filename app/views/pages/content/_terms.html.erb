(together with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, "Hungryhead," "we," or "us"), you’re agreeing to these legally binding agreement(the "Terms", even if you are using our Services on behalf of a institution). You’re also agreeing to our <%= link_to('Privacy Policy', privacy_path) %> and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our <%= link_to('Community Guidelines', rules_path) %>.
