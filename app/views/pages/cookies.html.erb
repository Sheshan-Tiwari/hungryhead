          <p class="fs-16 text-master">
           A Cookie (not to be confused with the literal definition), is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored into your web browser while you are browsing a website.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-16 text-master">
            A cookie may send anonymous information about how you use our Service to us but does not collect any personal information. All cookies have an expiry date and time, meaning they will only work for a particular time period. Some cookies have a longer lifetime than the others depending on the need. A persistent cookie, for example, have a longer lifetime and remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on future visits. A session cookie, on the other hand, is a temporary cookie and disappears after you close your browser. All cookies can be removed by going into your web browser's settings.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-16 text-master">
            You can reset your web browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some critical features of our Service may not function at all if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

          <h3 class="m-t-30 semi-bold">Pixel Tags (a.k.a Web beacons)</h3>
          <p class="fs-16 text-master">
           Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs or web beacons) are small snippets of code or images embedded on our website and in an email that help us to learn how you interact with our Service.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-16 text-master">
            When you use our Service, we may use Pixel tags, which are used to track the online usage patterns anonymously. No personal information from your Hungryhead account is collected using these tags. We may also use these tags in our emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more meaningful reporting and make Hungryhead better for our community.
