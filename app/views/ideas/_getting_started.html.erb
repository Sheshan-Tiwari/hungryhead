				<h2>1. Be a company, not a project</h2>
				<p>We help for-profit ideas find passionate investors to help them succeed. For non-profits, hobbies, or projects, we recommend Kickstarter or Indiegogo.</p>
				<h2>2. Raise from investors, not customers pre-buying products</h2>
				<p>Companies must sell shares or issue convertible debt. If you'd like to raise funding by pre-selling your product, Kickstarter is a great option</p>
				<h2>3. Reasonably expect to deliver a return to investors</h2>
				<p>We understand ideas are risky, but investors on Wefunder shouldn't have to depend on hell freezing over to earn a return. If you've got a cool lifestyle business that funds your exotic travels to study the breeding habits of monkeys, Indiegogo or Petridish might be a better fit.</p>
				<h2>4. Offer ownership to your most passionate users</h2>
				<p>The power of crowd investing lies in giving your most evangelical users a stake in the company. This feeling of ownership motivates them to help your company even more! Since most value-add investors arenâ€™t wealthy, Wefunder is not intended for companies that only accept funding from accredited investors.</p>
